I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at [Honey](http://www.joinhoney.com/). My focus is on recommender systems for online shopping along with improving search for products. 

I worked on building a recommender system for news articles utilizing online learning (see the talk I gave about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFqHI1SpYWc)) at my last company, Tribune Publishing. 

I focus primarily on natural language processing, recommender systems, and scaling algorithms in production (making me essentially a machine learning engineer most of the time). 

I have also completed my Ph.D. at [Texas A&M University in Atmospheric Science](http://atmo.tamu.edu/). My research focused on numerical climate and weather prediction. More specifically, I was investigating the performance of regional and global coupled models in how they resolve the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere at high resolutions.
