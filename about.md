I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at [tronc](http://www.tronc.com/). I  worked on building a recommender system for news articles utilizing online learning (see the talk I gave about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFqHI1SpYWc)), along with additional work on article popularity, churn prediction, unsupervised representations of content, and contextual advertising. Some of the online news outlets at tronc include the [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/) and [New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com). I focus primarily on natural language processing, recommender systems, and scaling algorithms in production (making me essentially a machine learning engineer most of the time). 

I have also completed my Ph.D. at [Texas A&M University in Atmospheric Science](http://atmo.tamu.edu/). My research focused on numerical climate and weather prediction. More specifically, I was investigating the performance of regional and global coupled models in how they resolve the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere at high resolutions.
