I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at [tronc](http://www.tronc.com/), working on building a recommender system for news articles and understanding customer behavior for a variety of online news content. Some of the online news outlets at tronc include the [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/)  and [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/).

I have also completed my Ph.D. at [Texas A&M University in Atmospheric Science](http://atmo.tamu.edu/). My research focused on numerical climate and weather prediction. More specifically, I was investigating the performance of regional and global coupled models in how they resolve the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere at high resolutions.
