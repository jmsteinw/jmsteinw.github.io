I am currently a Data Scientist at [Argo Group insurance](https://www.argolimited.com/pages/argo-group-home), working on bringing advanced analytics to specialty and reinsurance products. 

I am also in the final stages of being a Ph.D. Candidate at [Texas A&M University in Atmospheric Science](http://atmo.tamu.edu/). My research focuses on numerical climate and weather prediction. More specifically, I am investigating the performance of regional and global coupled models in how they resolve the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere at high resolutions.
