I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at [Texas A&M University in Atmospheric Science](http://atmo.tamu.edu/). My research focuses on numerical climate and weather prediction. More specifically, I am investigating the performance of regional and global coupled models in how they resolve the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere at high resolutions. 

 In the summer of 2014, I was a Data Science Intern at [HMS](http://hms.com/), a healthcare company focused on reviewing claims data. My focus during the internship was on finding fraudulent healthcare providers. To do this, I used automated SQL queries that would look for suspicious patterns and run them in combination with R and the teradataR library for analysis and visualization. Some of the patterns I investigated included:

- providers charging unusually high amounts compared to their peers 
- rapid acceleration in the number of claims being filed over short time periods
- high ratios of claims filed per unique patient 

The latter feature seemed especially promising.

 I plan on defending my dissertation in October of 2015 and am currently looking for a full-time Data Scientist position.
